        <h2 class="heading">Ayurveda Dosha Test — find out your type.</h2>
        <p>Knowing your personal mind-body-constitution is crucial to make Ayurveda work for you since its
            effectiveness
            is based on treating people individually. You see, every person is influenced by all three Doshas, but
            they
            manifest differently in everyone of us.

            This Ayurveda Test will give you a hint about your “Prakriti” (also called Prakruti in many places) —
            your
            birth constitution that doesn’t change throughout your life. It is made up from your parents’
            disposition
            and determines your main physical characteristics and emotional behaviour. So knowing your ayurvedic
            type
            will help you figuring out a diet and lifestyle that are perfect for you personally and how to find the
            remedies that work for you.
            It will also help you understanding yourself better; why you are the way you are and act the way you
            act.
            However online tests can never give you perfectly accurate results, so once you know your Doshas keep
            observing yourself to deepen your knowledge about your Prakriti.</p>
